# Pathfinder

A many-to-many variant of the Dijkstra's shortest distance algorithm.

Originally developed to predict the locations of medium-voltage electrical distribution grid infrastructure using publicly available data sources.

How pathfinder works is described in the Model Tutorial in this repo.
Notes on implementation and operation are embedded as comments within the code.
