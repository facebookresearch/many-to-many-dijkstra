    Find the shortest paths between *any* origin and *each* target.

    Pathfinder is a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm) for finding
    the shortest distance between two points in a graph. It differs in
    a few important ways:

    * It finds the shortest distance between a target point and the
        nearest of a set of origin points. This is then repeated for
        each target point.
    * It assumes a gridded topology. In other words, it knows that
        each node only
        touches its neighbors to the north, south, east, west,
        northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.

    Like Dijkstra's, Pathfinder assumes that all weights are 0 or greater.
    Negative weights are set to zero.  All input arrays (origins,
    targets, and weights) need to have the same number of rows and columns.

    @param origins, targets: 2D numpy array of ints
        Any non-zero values are the locations of origin and target points,
        respectively. Note that both may be modified. Target points may
        be removed, once paths to them are found and origins may be
        augmented (see path_handling param below).
        If targets is not supplied, no targets are assumed and a targets
        array of all zeros is created. This is useful for calculating minimum
        distances from a set of origins to all points of the grid.
    @param weights: 2D numpy array of floats
        The cost of visiting a grid square, zero or greater.
        For favorable (easy to traverse) grid locations, this is low.
        For unfavorable grid locations, this is high.
        If not supplied, a weights array of all ones is used. This is
        useful for calculating as-the-crow-flies distance.
    @param path_handling: string
        One of {'link', 'assimilate', 'none', 'l', 'a', 'n'}.
        Determines how to handle paths between target and origins,
        once they are found.

        * 'link' or 'l'  adds a target to the origins once it is found,
            as well as the path connecting them. This mode
            is good for growing a network by connecting nodes, as we do here
            when planning or estimating an electrical grid.
        * 'assimilate' or 'a' adds a target to the origins once it is found,
            but does not add the path connecting them. This mode
            is good for growing a network by adding nodes that
            have no physical connection between them, as in planning an
            ad-hoc wireless network.
        * 'none' or 'n' doesn't add a target to the to the origins
            once it is found. This mode is good for finding a path
            from a backbone or trunk to many leaf nodes,
            as in planning fiber backhaul routing.

    @param debug: boolean
        If True, provide text updates on the algorithm's progress.
    @param film: boolean
        If True, periodically save snapshots of the algorithm's progress.

    @retun results: dict
        'paths': 2D numpy array of ints
            1 where paths have been found, and 0 everywhere else.
        'distance: 2D numpy array of floats
            The length of the shortest path (the sum of the weights of grid
            cells traversed) from the nearest origin point to every point
            on the grid. Origin points have a distance of zero, and it
            goes up from there the further away you get.
        'rendering': 2D numpy array of floats
            An image representing the final state of the algorithm, including
            paths found and distances calculated.
